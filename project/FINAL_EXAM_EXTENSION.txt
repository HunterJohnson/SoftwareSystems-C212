Extension Selected?

--- MiddleProximityPlayer , WinBlockingPlayer (incomplete EC attempt)

What you were able to accomplish towards completing this extension?

--- I completed the extension and added MiddleProximityPlayer as a playable option in my game setup/PlayerChoice panels.

What problems did you encounter?

--- I had problems with the for loop that determined/returned the move with the closest distance to the center of the board.

How did you overcome those problems?

--- After moving things around a bit, I found that my program worked if I declared the move to be returned
 [initialized as legalMoves.get(0)] outside of the loop but kept the parameter for distance [dfc] inside of the loop.

What problems were you unable to solve?

--- N/A

How would you try to solve these problems if you had more time? (Be as specific as possible!)
